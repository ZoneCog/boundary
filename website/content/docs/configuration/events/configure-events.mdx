# Configure events

You can log system information in a well-defined, structured format that give you visibility into emitted events.

Event sinks provide a location for Boundary to write events to.
You can configure sinks to allow or deny specific event types using filter syntax.
There are two types of event sinks:

- `stderr` - Sends events to a stderr.
- `file` - Sends events to a file.

You can repeat the `sink` stanza multiple times to send events to multiple sinks, but each file sink must have a unique path and file name.

When you configure a sink, you can specify what types of events should be emitted by Boundary:

- `audit_enabled` - Specifies if audit events should be emitted.
- `observations_enabled` - Specifies if observation events should be emitted.
- `sysevents_enabled` - Specifies if system events should be emitted.
- `telemetry_enabled` - Specifies if telemetry events should be emitted.
To receive telemetry events, you must also set `observations_enabled` to `true`.
