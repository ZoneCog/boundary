# Configure events

You can log system information in a well-defined, structured format that give you visibility into emitted events.

Event sinks provide a location for Boundary to write events to.
You can configure sinks to allow or deny specific event types using filter syntax.
There are two types of event sinks:

- `stderr` - Sends events to a stderr.
- `file` - Sends events to a file.

You can repeat the `sink` stanza more than once to send events to multiple sinks, but each file sink must have a unique path and file name.

When you configure a sink, you can specify what types of events Boundary should emit:

- `audit_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary emits audit events.
- `observations_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary emits observation events.
- `sysevents_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary should emit system events.
- `telemetry_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary should emit telemetry events.
To receive telemetry events, you must also set `observations_enabled` to `true`.

You configure event sinks in the configuration file for a controller or worker server.
The following example includes the contents of the `events` stanza in the `compose/controller.hcl` configuration file:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```hcl
events {
  audit_enabled        = true
  observations_enabled = true
  sysevents_enabled    = true
  telemetry_enabled    = true

  sink "stderr" {
    name        = "all-events"
    description = "All events sent to stderr"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format      = "cloudevents-json"
  }

  sink {
    name        = "controller-audit-sink"
    description = "Audit sent to a file"
    event_types = ["audit"]
    format      = "cloudevents-json"

    file {
      path      = "/logs"
      file_name = "controller.log"
    }

    audit_config {
      audit_filter_overrides {
        secret    = "encrypt"
        sensitive = "hmac-sha256"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
