## Session recording

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

[Session recording](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording) requires at least one Worker with access to local and remote storage.
Workers used for session recording require an accessible directory defined by `recording_storage_path` for storing in-progress session recordings. On session closure, a local session recording is moved to remote storage and deleted locally.

The `recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity` value determines the minimum amount of storage space that is required for workers to perform session recording operations. If a worker is at or below the storage threshold, Boundary does not use the worker to record sessions or play back recordings.

Development example:

```hcl
worker {
  auth_storage_path="/var/lib/boundary"
  initial_upstreams = ["10.0.0.1"]
  recording_storage_path="/local/storage/directory"
  recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity="500MB"
}
```
