Regardless of registration mechanism, the following fields are supported.

```hcl
worker {
  public_addr = "5.1.23.198"

  # Local storage path required if session recording is enabled
  recording_storage_path = "tmp/boundary/"

  # Minimum available disk space required in the local storage path if session recording is enabled
  recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity = "500MB"

  # Mutually exclusive with hcp_boundary_cluster_id
  initial_upstreams = [
    "10.0.0.1",
    "10.0.0.2",
  ]

  tags {
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
    region = ["us-east-1"]
  }

  # HCP Boundary only
  # hcp_boundary_cluster_id = "....."
}
```

- `public_addr` - Specifies the public host or IP address (and optionally port)
  at which the worker can be reached _by clients for proxying_. This defaults to
  the address of the listener marked for `proxy` purpose. This is especially
  useful for cloud environments that do not bind a publicly accessible IP to a
  NIC on the host directly, such as an Amazon EIP.

  This value can reference any of the following:
  - a direct address string
  - a file on disk (file://) from which an address will be read
  - an env var (env://) from which the address will be read

- `initial_upstreams` - A list of hosts/IP addresses and optionally ports for
  reaching the boundary cluster. The port will default to `:9201` if not
  specified. This value can be a direct access string array with the addresses,
  or it can refer to a file on disk (`file://`) from which the addresses will be
  read, or an env var (`env://`) from which the addresses will be read. When
  using env or file, their contents must formatted as a JSON array:
  `["127.0.0.1", "192.168.0.1", "10.0.0.1"]`

  HCP Boundary workers require the [`hcp_boundary_cluster_id`](/boundary/docs/configuration/worker/#hcp_boundary_cluster_id) parameter instead of `initial upstreams`.
  If you configure an HCP worker with `initial_upstreams`, the worker configuration fails.

- `hcp_boundary_cluster_id` - A string required to configure workers using worker-led or controller-led registration
  to connect to your HCP Boundary cluster rather than specifying
  `initial_upstreams`. This parameter is currently only valid for workers using the worker-led or controller-led
  registration method and for workers directly connected to HCP Boundary.

- `recording_storage_path` - A path to the local storage for recorded sessions.
   Session recordings are stored in the local storage while they are in progress.
   When the session is complete, Boundary moves the local session recording to remote storage and deletes the local copy.

- `recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity` - A value measured in bytes that defines the worker's local storage state.
   Boundary compares this value with the available local disk space found in the `recording_storage_path` to determine if a worker can be used for session recording operations.
   The supported suffixes are kb, kib, mb, mib, gb, gib, tb, tib, which are not case sensitive. Example: 2GB, 2gb, 2GiB, 2gib.
   The possible storage states based on the `recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity` are:
    - Available - The worker is above the storage threshold and is available to proxy sessions that are enabled with session recording.
    - Low storage - The worker is below the storage threshold. Existing sessions can continue without interruption, but new sessions that are enabled with session recording cannot be proxied. The worker is not available to record new sessions or play back existing recordings.
    - Critically low storage - The worker is below half the storage threshold. Existing sessions that are enabled with session recording will be forcefully closed. The worker is not available to record new sessions or play back existing recordings.
    - Out of storage - The worker is out of local disk space. It is not available to record new sessions or play back existing recordings. The worker is in a unrecoverable state. An administrator must intervene to remedy the issue.
    - Not configured - The worker does not have a local storage path configured.
    - Unknown - The default local storage state of a worker. This state indicates that the local storage state of a worker is not yet known.

- `tags` - A map of key-value pairs where values are an array of strings. Most
  commonly used for [filtering](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering) targets a
  worker can proxy via [worker
  tags](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/worker-tags). On `SIGHUP`, the tags
  set here will be re-parsed and new values used. It can also be a string
  referring to a file on disk (`file://`) or an env var (`env://`).
