The `worker` stanza configures Boundary worker-specific parameters.

All workers within Boundary use certificates and encryption keys to identify
themselves and protect data in transit. However, there are three different
ways to register them so that registration of workers can fit into any workflow; controller-led, worker-led, and via external KMS.

The differences in how they are configured are in the sub-pages linked at the
bottom of this page.

Workers registered via the worker-led or controller-led methods must be registered in
the system via an API call, and require storage on disk to store the current set
of credentials. Workers registering via an external KMS auto-register after successful authentication, making them an easy mechanism to
use for automatic scaling. This also means they are not required to store
credentials locally; each time they connect the KMS is used to reauthenticate
them.

~> Prior to version 0.15 of Boundary, there were two different types of workers, PKI & KMS workers.
If you are using pre-0.15 workers, with pre-0.15 upstreams please be sure to switch the documentation
version to `0.13.x` - `0.14.x` for correct information.
